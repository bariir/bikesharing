## Overview of the statistical bikesharing analysis.

The purpose of this bikesharing analysis is based on Kate’s need to tailor NYC CitiBike Sharing to her local market in Des Moines, Iowa. She will need to analyze the public data from the CitiBike, looking at various data points such as overall checkout times, checkout times by gender, trips by weekday or each out, trips by weekday by gender (weekday per hour), average trip duration and such. Kate’s main goal is to attract investors and provide compelling analysis with visualization based on stories.

## Tools and Software: 
- Tableau Public, Pandas, and Git Bash to commit changes into GitHub Repository. 


# Results
Kate’s goal is to identify the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week and finally, show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. All of these data points will be used in her analysis to create stunning and compelling stories using Tableau visualization tool.
